title: I trusted you

Project Goal:

Built and improved upon the design of the Printrbot Simple 3D printer 

I know everything. You told me multiple times that our break-up was due to my unfounded trust issues and distance. The reality is that it was you who allowed the relationship to fall apart. You had an affair with Alex and never thought once to mention it to your ex-best friend. My not trusting your interactions with Alex Morrison were based in fact and you tried to manipulate me into thinking it was my fault (seriously, fuck you). My initial thoughts were that this was a one-time thing and perhaps a mistake on your part but the reality is that it happened multiple times and in short succession of seeing me without any distance between us. Two weeks after I left to San Jose you fucked Alex, and then a week after that you flew out to visit me (this is just one example). None of this includes all of the disgusting things youâ€™ve talked to him about right under my nose. It was your lack of self control and disingenuous behavior which caused the relationship and our friendship to fail. 

I cannot be friends, acquaintances or even remotely involved with someone who does something of that magnitude. This is a formal goodbye, I will not be speaking with you again and I wish you luck in your future.
