Project Goal:

Designed and modeled acoustical louvers for an internship with Sullair

Project Details:

Over the course of my internship in New Product Development, I was tasked with redesigning the acoustical louvers for the air compressor enclosures. The previous designs in use were not tested for performance and needed to be optimized for air flow and sound abatement. This project was critical because the louvers had to pass government set sound levels to be used commercially outdoors and the louvers needed to prevent pressure drop across the louver blades so that the fan motors would not stall. 
My first steps were determining the user needs and researching louver design. After I gathered all of the design requirements I brainstormed design ideas that would both meet the requirements and still be cost effective. Once I decided on a design for the louvers, I modeled test cases in NX to run through CFD. The models tested multiple physical characteristics of the louvers to determine which dimensions would optimize for performance as defined by the user requirements. I produced a novel design that significantly decreased the pressure drop across the louvers while still damping the noise made by the fan and air compressor.
