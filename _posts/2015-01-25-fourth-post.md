Project Goal:

Work with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies to design the tube for the Hyperloop

Project Details:

I am working with a team of dedicated engineers at Purdue University to design the tube for Elon Musk's Hyperloop. A startup company named Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) has picked up the project and is determined to make this idea come to life. We are currently collaborating with the companie's CEO, Dirk Ahlborn, to design a suitable tube for the Hyperloop cars to travel through. 

More on this project to come!
