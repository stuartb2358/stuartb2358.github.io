title: Amphibious Bicycle Kit Design
---

Project Goal:

Designed a product that would aid in natural disasters and created a business plan for manufacturing and selling the product

Project Details:

This product was created in my sophomore design class. In teams of four, we went through the entire design process from customer research to prototyping and presenting our business plan to a panel of engineers. The goal was to design a product that would aid in rescue during natural disasters. My team created an affordable amphibious bike kit that allowed a user to attach the kit to their bike and maneuver in water.
We went through multiple design iterations, focusing on user needs and basic functions. It was important that we considered cost and design for manufacturing as well. We then modeled all of the pieces of the kit in Solidworks and created a bill of materials for the assembly. With the bill of materials we determined the cost of our product and the production rate. The final presentation and write up can be found in the .pdf files below.
